### Installation

> Recommended way: If you want to contribute to this theme or open issues due to problems implementing this on your own, I would recommend forking the [Neumorphism](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism) repository directly. This makes it easier for me to solve open issues and questions or check pull requests.

+ Two ways :
  + Fork the repository (using the `Fork` button at the top) and then clone the repository

  + Create your own repository (using the green `Use this template` button at the top) and then clone the repository

```sh
# Replace {YOUR_USERNAME}, {YOUR_REPOSITORY} with the actual values
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY}.git
```

2: Change directory into minimalist-neumorphism

```sh
cd minimalist-neumorphism
```

3: Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
bundle update
bundle install
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/bin
bundle add webrick
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

* Run and develop locally with live server at `http://localhost:4000`
* In two different terminals :
```sh
sass --watch _sass/main.scss assets/css/main.min.css
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

* After committing and pushing, see the `Settings` page of your repository to see where your site is published at via `Github Pages`.

### Personalize and Customize

#### _config.yml

Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site. For documentation, refer to [docs/config.md](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism/blob/master/docs/config.md).

#### Github Metadata Plugin

If you want to automatically have your Github repositories pulled for the *Open Source Projects* section, then you also need to authenticate yourself for the Github Metadata plugin to work.

You need to generate a new personal access token on GitHub:

* Go to the [Github Token site](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
* Select the scope `public_repository`, and add a description.
* Confirm and save the settings. Copy the token you see on the page.
* Create a `.env` file inside your repository and add your generated `JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```text
JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN=0YOUR0GENERATED0TOKEN0
```

To complete the configuration for the Github Metadata plugin, you also need to change the value of `repository` inside `_config.yml`. After this, you should the Github Metadata plugin should work properly.

For optimal results, you should make sure, that every Github project, you want included on this portfolio, has added following informations on Github:

* Description
* Homepage link, if there is a live version of it
* Topics

Example:
![Github Repository Information Example][github-repo-info]

#### _data/*.yml

Edit files inside `_data` to add information to the portfolio. For documentation, refer to [docs/data.md](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism/blob/master/docs/data.md).

#### Particles.js

Edit `assets/particles.json` to customize the landing page backgorund animation. For more information, refer to [this](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/#options).
